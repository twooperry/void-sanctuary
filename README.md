🕳️ Void Sanctuary

Automated Faceless Content Generator · Python | MoviePy | Groq | Edge-TTS

Void Sanctuary is a growing toolkit for generating faceless YouTube videos and shorts — fully automated.
What started as a single Python script using MoviePy, Groq’s LLM API, and Edge-TTS is evolving into a scalable system for hands-free content creation.

Right now, it can:

Generate scripts using Groq’s fast LLM inference

Convert text to natural-sounding voiceovers with Edge-TTS

Build complete videos or shorts using MoviePy

Produce consistent, faceless content ready for upload

But this is just the foundation.

🚧 Roadmap

Modular pipeline for easier automation

GUI application version

API endpoints for external integrations

Full SaaS platform for automated faceless-content production

Template system for styles, niches, and upload formats

💭 Vision

Void Sanctuary is built for creators who want the output of a full production studio — without showing their face, touching a camera, or spending hours editing.
One command. Infinite content.
